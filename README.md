# Machi Koro - Ruby + React

## App Idea

Display Machi Koro cards and their attributes. A user would be able to view the card, and the type of establishment (primary, secondary, restaurant, major). Create a backend using Ruby, ActiveRecord and Rack while using React for the front end.

## MVP

- [x] Access a Sqlite3 database using Active Record.
- [x] You should have a minimum of two models with a one to many relationship.
- [x] You should build out a simple React frontend to give your user 3 of the 4 CRUD abilities for at least one of your resources. For example, build out a todo list. A user should be able to create a new todo, see all todos, update a todo item, and delete a todo. Todos can be grouped into categories, so that a todo has many categories and categories have many todos.
- [x] Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for your models.

## Stretch Goals

- [x] Filter cards by establishment type
- [ ] Responsive Design for application
- [ ] Add some animations throughout the application
- [ ] Migrate from CSS to SASS
- [ ] Add frontend validations with Formik and Yup
- [ ] Add HTTP Error handling on frontend
- [ ] Add some analytics (graphs)
